      <p>The Tower Grove Drive residence is a hillside retreat, engaged in and respectful of nature, where harmony is created through the balance between openness and seclusion, understatement and elegance, modernity and warmth, permanence and levity. It is at once a peaceful retreat and a stimulating creative environment, a timeless indoor-outdoor setting with hints of unpredictability at the heart of its character.</p>
