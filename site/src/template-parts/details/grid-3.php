        <span>As a built manifestation, the home is "village like" in its massing, in deference to living on a modest scale. The outlying vistas are drawn into the interior of the house as much as possible thru the integration of floor to ceiling glass walls and operable doors systems. The home is natural and sustainable in its specification of materials and engineering systems. FSC-certified wood, photovoltaic and solar water-heating systems, a greywater recycling system, low energy glazing systems, recycled materials and native planting are used throughout.</span>
